# Kazoup binary

Wrapper for all Kazoup microservices alowes running all services from one comand line
This is usefull for desktop application as it creates smaller binary for distribution 
Secondly it's cool to have kazoup command line executable !


##Example

```

kazoup --registry=mdns auth api
kazoup --registry=mdns config srv

```
