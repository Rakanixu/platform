## Development

If you wish to work on your element in isolation, we recommend that you use
[Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep your element's
bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve

Once running, you can preview your element at
`http://localhost:8080/components/paper-audio-player/`

To work with Demo page styling with Sass, install grunt and its plugins:

    npm install

After you made any changes, create new CSS file:

    gulp

This will convert Sass into CSS and run [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/).

## Testing

The tests are compatible with [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).
Install it via:

    npm install -g web-component-tester

Then, you can run your tests on _all_ of your local browsers via:

    wct

Or, simply navigate to the `/test` directory if you are using Polyserve: `http://localhost:8080/components/paper-audio-player/test/`

#### WCT Tips

`wct -l chrome` will only run tests in chrome.

`wct -p` will keep the browsers alive after test runs (refresh to re-run).

`wct test/some-file.html` will test only the files you specify.
